This project introduces the concept of binary trees and how to implement them in C.
It focuses on building the fundamental operations used to create, manipulate, and analyze tree data structures.
The tasks cover essential topics such as node creation, inserting children, deleting entire trees, and checking node relationships (leaf, root, sibling).
You also implement key tree measurements like height, depth, size, and balance factor, along with traversal techniques (pre-order, in-order, post-order, and level-order).
The goal of this project is to deepen understanding of dynamic memory, recursion, pointers, and hierarchical data structures through practical implementation of binary tree algorithms.
